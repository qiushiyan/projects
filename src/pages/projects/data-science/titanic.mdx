  Ok I promise you this is not one of Kaggle's introduction to machine learning tutorials. This is a rather pedantic study using the most up-to-date and complete Titanic dataset from encyclopedia-titanica.org to model survival rates. The modeling process includes redundancy analysis, multiple imputation, penalization, bootstrap validation, partial dependence and so on.
